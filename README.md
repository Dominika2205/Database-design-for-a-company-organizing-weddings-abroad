# Database-design-for-a-company-organizing-weddings-abroad
This project deals with the activities of a company that organizes weddings abroad. The company offers a wide range of travel destinations, tailored to the needs of brides and grooms. Each trip has different variants, taking into account the number of participants in the ceremony.
As part of the project's implementation, data is collected on:
● Trips completed,
● Operating costs of the company,
● Price list of services,
● Information on customers and employees,
● Employee salaries, including both base salary and
commission on tour sales.
By analyzing the collected data, it is possible to determine, among other things:
● Which employees generate the most revenue for the company,
● Which tours are most popular,
● Seasonality of sales - in which months customers use the services most often.
